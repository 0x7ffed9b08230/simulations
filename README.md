<summary> Langton's Ant </summary>

This is an implementation of Langton's Ant in C. Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. The ant moves according to the rules below:

1. At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.

2. At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.

This simulation uses the following characters to represent the ant and the grid:

- `.` represents a white square.
- `#` represents a black square.
- `A` represents the ant.
